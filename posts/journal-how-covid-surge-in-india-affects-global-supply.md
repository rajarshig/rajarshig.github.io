# How Covid surge in India affects the global vaccine supply

India is one of the major producers of vaccines for global usage. Around the year 2020, WHO envisaged a plan to provide sufficient Covid-19 vaccines to selected lower-income countries.
A majority of vaccines for this plan were to be produced in indian companies. However, around early 2021, a sudden surge of local covid cases in India pushed the local demand for vaccination.
This led the Indian government to temporarily restrict vaccine export which jeopardised the global vaccine distribution plan. In turn, this event puts pressure on developed countries to open up vaccine exports.

As per recommendations of global researchers, early vaccination for majority of the global population is the only way to restrict the mutations of Covid vaccines. The longers people remain unvaccinated, the higher the chances of new & possibly deadlier variants appearing by mutation.
What is even more concerning is the fact that there is not enough knowledge or confidence in the medical community about how useful the current vaccines will be against new variants.

So in summary, the global race to contain Covid & its variants are not very encouraging. One can only that the global leaders & agencies get together to plan & execute the vaccination drive in the most timely & efficient manner in the coming days.
